## Instructions:

The `Avatar` component with styling in `index.css` is already wired up, but it's being rendered manually, copy/pasted with different data.

- You should create an array that holds the data needed for all avatars.
- That array should be iterated over, creating an `<Avatar />` element for each item in the array.
- There should be no key warnings in the console.
